              " \"This research analyses the relationship between military expenditure and national income with the aim of testing Wagner's law for the G5 Sahel countries over the period 1984 to 2018. The effect of corruption on the stability of this law is also taken into account. To achieve these objectives, the model of Peacock and Wiseman (1961) is used and estimated using the multiple structural breaks method of Bai and Perron (2003). The results show that this law is confirmed for all the countries of the Sahel G5 with variability according to different time regimes. However, the defense sector, which used to be a superior public good, becomes an inferior one because of corruption. Thus, virtuous governance in the defense sector must be a priority for the G5 Sahel countries in order to allocate resources in an optimal and efficient way. \",\n",

              " 'In recent years, Sub-Saharan African countries have been confronted with insecurity linked to terrorist attacks. This insecurity is one of the characteristics of underdevelopment (Brunel, 1996). One of the most unstable regions of Sub-Saharan Africa most affected by terrorism is the Sahel, which has seen the creation by five countries (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) of the G5 Sahel, which is an institutional framework for coordinating and monitoring regional cooperation on development and security policies. Between 2019 and 2020, terrorist attacks increased by more than 16%, from an average of 48 attacks per month to 69 attacks (African Centre for Study and Research on Terrorism ACSRT, 2020). Burkina Faso is the most affected country with an average of 34 attacks per month, followed by Mali, Niger, and then Chad (ACSRT, 2020).  ',\n",
              " \"Faced with these attacks, countries are obliged to make budgetary efforts to make the army more operational in order to put an end to terrorism. Thus, military spending has undergone a significant and unstable evolution over the period 1984 to 2018. They evolved in a stable manner until 2005 when they experienced a considerable increase, in Chad, and then in the other countries from 2013 onwards (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute SIPRI, 2019). According to the SIPRI, in 2018, Mali's military expenditures amounted to $495 million, compared to $312 million for Burkina Faso, $232 million for Chad, $229 million for Niger, and $159 million for Mauritania (Institute for Security Studies, 2020). In the case of Mali in 2015 and Burkina Faso in 2017, to strengthen the army, military programming laws were adopted. \",\n",
              " \"On the other hand, the countries' gross domestic product (GDP) has risen considerably since 2000. The evolution of these two variables shows a contrast as to a possible link between them (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In Burkina Faso, the year 2018 saw the largest increase in budget allocations for the Ministry of Defense by 48.98% (CIFOEB, 2019). In addition to the budgetary efforts to revive the defense sector, the G5 Sahel countries are faced with the problem of corruption, which is rampant in the zone and affects both the economic growth of these countries and their military spending. Corruption represents a major obstacle to economic and social development by impinging on public finances (Abed and Gupta, 2002). Gupta et al. (2001) show that defense spending may be used as a component of an indicator of the quality of governance. Their results suggest that corruption is associated with higher military spending as a share of both GDP and total government spending, as well as with arms procurement in relation to GDP and total government spending. Also, Hamid and Sakiru (2019) shown across different measures of military spending, countries with higher levels of corruption tend to exhibit higher levels of military expenditures. In some countries, such as Mali, a special parliamentary commission of inquiry has been set up to carry out budgetary control of defense and security spending. \",\n",
              " \"The increase in public spending induced by the increase in national income, leads Wagner (1883) to develop his law that stipulates a positive relationship between economic development and public spending (for defense, public investment in infrastructure, health and education). Wagner's contribution appears influential and important to this day, as he was the first economist to postulate active government intervention in the economy well before Keynes (Paparas et al., 2018). However, unlike Keynes, Wagner did not call for government intervention to stabilize the economy but to stabilize the political system. Wagner's law suggests a long-run unidirectional causality from economic growth to government spending, while Keynes (1936) argues that the causality runs from government spending to economic growth, i.e., increased government spending leads to a higher level of aggregate demand, which in turn promotes economic growth (Keho, 2016).  \",\n",
              " \"The theoretical underpinnings of Wagner's Law are proposed by Meltzer and Richard (1981) and Oxley (1994). The first study analyzes the law in the context of a game between the government and the electorate. Spending policies are tailored to satisfy the median voter and this behavior induces a relationship between government spending and national income. In contrast, Oxley (1994) idea is that bureaucrats are rational agents who derive utility from power and prestige and expand the size of their offices at the expense of efficiency. Empirical work confirms Wagner's law (Chang, 2002; Narayan et al., 2012; Kinda and Koinda, 2017; Keho, 2016; Ahmed and Hanif, 2018; Kumar and Cao, 2019), while it is refuted by others (Ghali, 1999; Burney, 2002; Huang, 2006). One of the first contributions of this research is the application of Wagner's law on military spending. Indeed, very few studies analyze this law in the African defense sector. The second contribution is the inclusion of corruption in the relationship between GDP and military spending. \",\n",
              " \"Thus, the objective of this research is to test Wagner's law applied to military expenditures in the G5 Sahel countries. Also, the stability of this law is tested in the presence of corruption. \",\n",
              " \"To achieve these objectives, this research uses the structural breaks method proposed by Bai and Perron (2003). This method is justified because the G5 Sahel countries have experienced several phases of instability, ranging from coup d'état to terrorist attacks, which have affected the evolution of economic growth and military spending.  \",\n",

Thus, the various states are obliged to mobilize significant resources to defeat terrorism. Figure 1 below shows the evolution of military spending in the five G5 Sahel countries over the period 1984 to 2018. For all of these countries, we see stability in military spending from 1984 to 2005. Chad stood out with an increase in military spending from 2005 to 2013, which remains higher than that of Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. However, these expenditures decline from 2013 to 2018. Thus, there is a break in Chad's spending from 2013. From 2005 to 2013, a slight increase in military spending is observed for the other G5 Sahel countries. This increase becomes more pronounced from 2015 onwards, when we see a growing trend in these expenditures for Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Indeed, these countries have been facing repeated terrorist attacks since 2015, which would justify the increase in military spending.  \",\n",

Also, this relationship can be influenced by the effect of corruption (Alesina and Weder, 2002: Bardhan, 2006). The literature review consists of two parts. The first part focuses on the verification of Wagner's Law while the second part focuses on the effect of corruption on government spending. The relationship between public spending and economic growth has been the subject of theoretical debate. While Wagner (1883), through his law, predicted that the share of public spending in gross domestic product would increase with the standard of living, Keynes (1936) considered public spending to be an exogenous variable of economic policy. \",\n",
              " 'According to Wagner (1883), the share of public expenditure in national income increases under the influence of industrialization. For the author, the more civilized society becomes, the more expensive the state becomes. He justifies this by two hypotheses: the economic growth of a country generates, on the one hand, the appearance of new needs in public infrastructure (regulation, protection, administration, education, social action), due to urbanization and the extent taken by the questions of organization; on the other hand, the tendency rise in the standard of living of a growing proportion of the population, and consequently, the increase in the demand for consumption of goods known as superior with strong elasticity to incomes, in other words leisure, culture, education, health and also security or national defense. ',\n",
              " \"On the other hand, Keynes (1936) justifies his argument by the fact that the State is supposed to control public spending and vary its level according to its macroeconomic objectives. Thus, the cause-and-effect relationship between public spending and economic growth is clear. Since military expenditure is a component of public expenditure, this implies that the increase in this expenditure may be a consequence of economic growth according to Wagner's law (1883) or rather a cause of the latter according to Keynes (1936). However, the existing empirical literature on the relationship between military spending and economic growth does not allow us to predict precisely the direction of causality between them. Indeed, the results of this empirical literature show that there are four different types of causal relationship between the two variables: bidirectional causality, which means that the two variables exert effects on each other; unidirectional causality from military spending to economic growth, which means that higher military spending would increase economic growth; unidirectional causality from economic growth to military spending, which means that a high level of income could determine military spending; and finally, no causal relationship, which means that there is no causal relationship between the two variables. \",\n",

Using error correction models, the author shows that income causes military spending. The growth in Bolivia's military spending is explained in terms of Wagner's law. Khalid and Mustapha (2014) analyze the relationship between economic growth and defense spending in India using annual data over the period 1980-2011. The results of Granger causality test reveal that there is a unidirectional relationship running from GDP to defense spending. This shows that GDP is very important for the military sector in India and efforts should be directed towards improving GDP per capita to increase defense spending and development in India.  \",\n",
              " \"Similarly, Cavicchioli and Pistoresi (2016) analyze the veracity of Wagner's law for Italian public defense spending over the period 1862-2009. The results of their study reveal the existence of a threshold cointegrating relationship between economic growth and public defense spending, which is found to be consistent with Wagner's law, given the different speeds of adjustment to the long-run trajectory. Keho (2016) tests the validity of Wagner's law for six African countries over the period 1960 to 2013 without highlighting military spending. The author uses Gregory and Hansen's (1996a) cointegration test that allows for a structural break in the long-run relationships. The results show evidence of the validity of Wagner's law in Ghana over the period 1960-2013 and in Côte d'Ivoire over the period 1960-1995. The evidence for Kenya over the period 1960-1991 supports both Wagner's law and the Keynesian view. The results for the other three countries, Benin, Senegal, and South Africa, do not support Wagner's law in the long run. \",\n",

Five variants of Wagner's law are tested for the period 2005-2014, using panel econometric approaches that include cointegration and causality. The study finds a long-run relationship between government spending and the different explanatory variables used as income indicators. Long-run causality tests indicate that there is bidirectional causality between expenditure and income in all models except the Gupta model. It is concluded that for sub-Saharan Africa, both Wagner's law and the Keynesian hypothesis tend to hold for the survey period. \",\n",

The country-by-country causality results reveal: (i) no causal relationship between military spending and growth in seven countries; (ii) unidirectional causality from military spending to growth in two countries; (iii) a unidirectional relationship from growth to military spending in fourteen countries; and (iv) a bidirectional relationship in twelve countries. These findings imply that economic growth causes military spending in fourteen African countries, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, and Mauritania. ',\n",

The Gregory and Hansen (1996b) and Carrion-i-Silvestre and Sanso (2006) tests found that there is a weak cointegrating relationship between the logarithm of nominal government spending as a share of nominal GDP versus the logarithm of real GDP per capita. However, the results support Wagner's law when the relationship between the two variables is extended by taking into account a Measure of population structure that is the dependency ratio. Thus, the authors conclude that Wagner's law is valid for East Asian countries. The break dates are fairly consistent across the three methods; most break dates indicate that East Asian countries experienced the Asian financial crisis and the Great Recession. \",\n",
              " \"This empirical literature does not provide a consensus on the meaning of the relationship between economic growth and military spending. The veracity of Wagner's law for military spending remains ambiguous and could be affected by the effect of corruption. At the macro level according to Chene (2014), the scientific literature generally shows that corruption has a direct negative impact on economic growth and development. Corruption also has an indirect effect on the economic efficiency of a country, through its impact on several factors that drive economic growth, such as investment, taxation as well as the level of public spending, its distribution and efficiency. To this end, for economists such as Collier (2000), corruption renders a large part of public spending inefficient. The author concludes that a high level of corruption hinders economic growth through spending. Usman and Habimana (2019) employ a wavelet approach to investigate the relationship between economic growth and military spending in a time-frequency domain for the case of Turkey. Timescale regression analysis reveals that military expenditures have significant negative effects on growth in per capita GDP at business cycles of 16 years and longer. Timescale Granger causality analysis indicates that per capita GDP growth responds to movements in military expenditures at business cycles of eight years and above and that this result is very significant.\",\n",

Indeed, a 1% increase in GDP leads to an increase in military spending of 3.57%, 1.79% and 5.48% in the first, second and third regimes respectively. These values are greater than 1, which confirms Wagner's law. We note that the effect in the third regime is very large, which can be explained by the security situation in Burkina Faso.  \",\n",
              " \"In the case of Mali, we note that the two periods of break are 2004 and 2012. Indeed, the year 2004 was marked by the organization of the African Cup of Nations and national communal elections. These events may explain the break in the evolution of the country's gross domestic product. As for 2012, it was marked by the rebellion initiated by the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which resulted in a military coup d'état the same year. This year was considered to be the year of all dangers and upset the economic situation in Mali. We find that Wagner's law holds true in all three regimes. Indeed, a 1% increase in GDP leads to an increase in military spending of 1.67%, 4.38% and 10.21%, respectively for the first, second and third regimes (1984-2003, 2004-2011, 2012-2018). However, it can be seen that the last regime, i.e. from 2012 to 2018, has had a major impact of GDP on military spending, with a Wagner coefficient of 10.21%, double the effects in the other regimes. In this period, a large part of the national wealth is devoted to securing the country, through increased military spending.  \",\n",
              " \"The third country in this research is Mauritania. The breaks periods are the years 2000 and 2008. The 2000s were marked by a spiral of terrorist attacks in Mauritania. Also, the country experienced a coup d'état in 2008, which weakened the national economic fabric, accompanied by the international financial crisis of 2008. These events could explain the two structural breaks that have occurred. Thus, Wagner's law is estimated in three regimes (1984-1999, 2000-2007 and 2008-2018). An increase in GDP of 1% leads to an increase in military expenditure of 2.92%, 1.01% and 2.11% respectively in the first, second and third regimes. There is an increase in the effect of GDP on military spending in the last regime (2008-2018), where the country is faced with sub-regional insecurity due to the terrorist threat. \",\n",
              " \"The break periods in the case of Niger are 1994 and 2000, which implies the presence of three regimes (1984-1993, 1994-1999, and 2000-2018) in the estimation of Wagner's law measured by the effect of GDP on military spending. The structural break in 1994 can be explained by the devaluation of the local money CFA and the rebellion of the period 1990-1996, with the creation of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Sahara in 1994. The break in 2000 can be explained by political instability and the organization of elections in 1999. Wagner's law is not verified in the first regime (1984-1993) because the effect of GDP on military spending is not significant. On the other hand, Wagner's law is verified in the second and third regimes, where a 1% increase in GDP leads to an increase in military spending of 4.17% and 8.75% respectively. The effect of the last regime is significant, which shows Niger's efforts to finance its military spending in recent years.  \",\n",
              " \"The fifth country in the research is Chad. The breaks periods observed are 2006 and 2014. The structural break observed during the 2006 period can be explained by the battle of N'Djamena, which pitted the Chadian army against the rebellion of the United Forces for Change. The break in 2014 can be explained by the unstable situation in 2013 with the failed coup d'état that the country experienced. Wagner's Law is verified in Chad in all three regimes (1984-2005, 2006-2013 and 2014-2018). Indeed, an increase in GDP of 1% leads to an increase in military spending of 1.03%, 2.68% and 1.02% respectively. We note that the Wagner coefficient of the second regime appears to be the highest, indicating a significant share of national wealth for military spending during the period 2006-2013. \",\n",
              " \"The results of the estimation of Wagner's law show that this law is confirmed for all the G5 Sahel countries with variability according to different time regimes. Thus, the elasticity of military spending with respect to gross domestic product is greater than unity, indicating that a 1% increase in GDP results in a more than proportional increase in military spending. These results are in line with those of Bojanic (2013), Cavicchioli and Pistoresi (2016), Ahmed and Hanif (2018), Saba and Ngepah (2019) and Kumar and Cao (2019). Despite these efforts, the G5 Sahel countries remain vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Thus, the problem of optimal use of these resources arises. It is in this perspective that we introduce the corruption variable in the analysis. Indeed, corruption can affect GDP and military spending. The results of the effect of corruption on Wagner's law, i.e., its effect on the impact of GDP on military spending, are reported in Appendix 2. Due to the unavailability of corruption data for Mauritania and Chad, we consider three countries, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger.  \",\n",
              " \"The effect of corruption on the relationship between GDP and military spending reveals three regimes in Burkina Faso and Mali. We note that Wagner's law is conditioned by the level of corruption. In all three regimes, corruption negatively affects the contribution of GDP to military spending. Indeed, an increase in the level of corruption leads to a decrease in the effect of GDP on military spending. Thus, corruption causes these countries to relegate defense and security to the background and thus become inferior goods. In the case of Niger, there is no break in the analysis of the effect of corruption. Thus, the result is for the period 1984-2018. Corruption leads to an increase in the contribution of GDP to military spending. This result in the case of Niger seems contradictory because a high level of corruption leads to an increase in the effect of GDP on military spending. However, this corruption may negatively affect the effectiveness of military spending in Niger. These results are confirmed by Chene (2014) and Collier (2000).  \",\n",

              " \"Insecurity is a phenomenon that negatively affects the development process of Sub-Saharan African countries in general, and those of the G5 Sahel in particular. Indeed, the affected countries are obliged to make budgetary efforts to equip their armies in order to overcome terrorism. Thus, the objective of this research is to test Wagner's Law in relation to military spending in the G5 Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Chad). The aim is to analyze how these expenditures evolve when the GDP of these countries increases. The study also analyzes the effect of corruption on this law.  \",\n",
              " \"To achieve these objectives, the research uses the Peacock and Wiseman (1961) model estimated by the method based on structural breaks of Bai and Perron (2003). This method is justified by the fact that the G5 Sahel countries have moments of socio-political instability over the study period (1984 to 2018). The results show that Wagner's law is verified for all G5 Sahel countries with variability according to different temporal regimes. Military expenditures represent superior goods whose importance varies according to different temporal regimes. However, taking corruption into account leads to a non-confirmation of Wagner's law in Burkina Faso and Mali and contributes to a decrease in the share of national income allocated to defense. In the case of Niger, the paradox that corruption leads to an increase in the share of income allocated to defense raises questions about the effectiveness and allocation of these expenditures. Virtuous governance in the defense sector must be a priority for the G5 Sahel countries, in order to lead to an optimal and efficient allocation of resources.  \",\n",
